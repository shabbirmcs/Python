Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",

        "Most of the programming languages like C, C++ and Java use curly braces { } to define a block of code. Python, however, uses indentation by using a colon at the end of the statement and all the statements will be considered part of the code block unless going back to the previous code block by pressing the backspace button from the keyboard. \n",
